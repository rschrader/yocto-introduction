# Yocto Introduction

This is a yocto example project, intended to be used to give an introduction to building an embedded linux system with yocto. The goal is to give a small insight of the concepts of yocto and create interest for embedded linux systems. 

This example project shows different concepts in three steps from building a raw poky image and booting it in a QEMU to extending your image with your own recipes and run them on a raspberrypi.

The tutorial steps are found here: [Tutorial.md](doc/Tutorial.md)
